<note>[2] PCA rotates your data so the maximum variance lies along the first new axis (PC1), the maximum
    remaining variance lies along the second axis (PC2, perpendicular to PC1), and so on. To visualize in
    2D, it projects your 768-dimensional points onto the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2),
    discarding the other dimensions.
    t-SNE focuses on preserving the local structure. It calculates a measure of similarity between pairs of
    points in the high-dimensional space (nearby points are considered similar). It then tries to arrange
    the points in the low-dimensional (2D) map so that similar high-dimensional points are close together
    and dissimilar points are far apart. It uses probabilities and an optimization process to achieve this
    arrangement.
