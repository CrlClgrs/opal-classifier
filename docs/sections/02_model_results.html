<p>The result is usually presented in the form of a confusion matrix:

</p>
<p>In this heatmap, we analyze the model's predictions, showing the average predicted probability for each
    tag category, likely correlated with the true categories.
    It's evident that the main tag categories are typically assigned high probabilities by the model,
    whereas some secondary categories present more of a challenge, receiving lower average probabilities.
</p>
<p>Overall, the results are encouraging. The primary tag (level 1) predictions are highly accurate (as seen
    by the blue vertical lines), while the secondary tag (level 2) predictions are less distinct. However,
    even when the secondary tag prediction is incorrect, it often falls within the expected category group.
</p>
<p>Further investigation into the specific prediction errors could be insightful.</p>
<blockquote>Such a deep dive might
    reveal patterns in the model's mistakes or even suggest potential ambiguities or inaccuracies in the
    original tagging of the questions.</blockquote>
<p>These are the confusion counts:

</p>
<p>This plot analyzes the model's predictions by considering the top two most likely tags assigned to each
    question.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that prediction errors are relatively infrequent, and most of them are concentrated
    within the central part of the visualization. This central region corresponds to questions covering very
    similar topics, which makes some level of confusion understandable.</p>
<p>Other areas prone to errors involve questions about traffic and those concerning the vehicle itself. For
    these topics, the original tagging may be inherently ambiguous or difficult to assign definitively,
    likely contributing to the model's confusion.</p>
