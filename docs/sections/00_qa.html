    <p><b>What is text classifying?</b><BR>
        Text classification is the task of automatically assigning predefined labels or categories to pieces
        of
        text.</p>
    <p><b>Why is it important?</b><BR>
        Text classification is important because it allows us to automatically make sense of and organize
        large
        volumes of text data, which would be impossible or incredibly time-consuming to do manually.</p>
    <p><b>Which techniques are commonly used?</b><BR>
        Common methods range from traditional algorithms (like Naive Bayes, SVM) to deep learning (like
        LSTMs or
        Transformers/BERT).</p>
    <p><b>Why does this suit very well with ML and AI approach?</b><BR>
        Because ML/AI excels at automatically learning complex patterns from text data to assign categories
        accurately, handling the nuance and scale of language far better than manual rules.</p>
    <p><b>What is the base technique behind this approach?</b><BR>
        The base technique is typically supervised machine learning. This means you train an algorithm using
        a
        large dataset of text examples that have already been manually assigned the correct category labels.
        The
        algorithm learns the patterns and relationships between the text features (words, embeddings, etc.)
        and
        the corresponding labels, enabling it to predict labels for new, unseen text.</p>
    <p><b>What is the embedding?</b><BR>
        Essentially, an embedding is the numerical vector (a list of numbers) used to represent a piece of
        text
        for the machine learning model. It's designed so that texts with similar meanings result in vectors
        that are mathematically close to each other.</p>
    <p><b>But how can I transform my text into an embedding?</b><BR>
        You typically use a pre-trained AI model (accessed via an API or code library) to convert your text
        into
        its numerical embedding vector.
    </p>
    <p><b>How can this be profitable?</b><BR>
        It's profitable by automating tasks (cutting costs) and extracting valuable insights from text data
        to
        improve customer experience, boost sales, and make smarter business decisions.
    </p>
    <p><b>What are some practical examples?</b><BR>
        Email spam filtering,
        customer support ticket routing,
        sentiment analysis,
        content moderation,
        topic labelling,
        intent recognition
