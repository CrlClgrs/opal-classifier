<h2>Section 5: The Clusters</h2>
<blockquote>But if we know the embedding vectors why not trying to build a classifcation possibly better
    than the one initially provided? </blockquote>
<p>The semantics and the concept relationships are somehow stored in the embedding vectors:
    so we can use them as an input for 'traditional' clusterization techniques in order to find a
    classification by ourselves.</p>
